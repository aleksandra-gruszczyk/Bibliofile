# Bibliofile - your personal book manager and data depository. 

Every self-respecting bookworm has a dream of their very own library. A library filled with books, yes, but also with data about the books. A place where one can store all the information they want about any book they've ever come into contact with, and be proud of how lovely it looks. </br> 
Bibliofile is that kind of space: a virtual library which offers nice large images of the covers and some fancy animations mimicking flipping between front and back of each book, as well as plenty of functionality for adding, editing and removing records.<br>
